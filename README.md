- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AnujDharurkar
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m always interested in learning new technologies and APIs. Recently I tried out Pytorch, flask, and Discord Bot to create an efficient Sarcasm Detection
     model based on the IEEE paper published on "Sarcasm Detection Using Multi-Head Attention Based Bidirectional LSTM".
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web-development and trying out React.
